### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is my first e-commerce Backend Development Project
it has 3 microservices
service discovery and API gateway fulfilling the role of cross-cutting concerns such as security.
The security is handled by a 3rd party open source application called Key Cloak used for access management
I have used niche techniques and Design patterns in my project such as builder design patterns, 
Service discovery and load balancing therefore my microservices hold the potential for scaling.
